I was supposed to present my three ideas for a prototype with my team mate. And I was nervous. I knew that the idea was scalable, but explaining it was not going to be easy. 

With innovative thinkers around me, I knew the impact came from the idea itself. And the objective was to provide clarity to the conceptual framework that we were presenting. The maps were to be drawn for:

A. “From paper work to epicurean experience”

Map and profile the user experience for WICK & SNAP
•	Map the signing up to the program and the process 
•	Taste profile and emotional profile 
•	Identify the location and density of people who use Wick&Snap

B. “From Wholefoods to Wholesome Food”

Map the nutrition levels around stores like Wholefoods and Walmart
•	Look at data for people living in that geographical area
•	Taste profile and emotional profile

C. “The journey of Spice”
 
Map the spice routes in 1800 and in the present day for 1 year
•	Data for ship and flight routes of spices for both periods
•	Kind of spices from the locations they originate from

Some resources for food considered nutritious and healthy, that we would use are:

And then the questions started...
