After a term of learning design process, we stepped into the world of prototyping. Class one onwards was action oriented. As part of a class activity, we were separated into 3 teams and given markers, coloured paper, cardbaord sheets and tape to build a map.

Our group of six brainstormed and came up with various ideas. We finally decided to map out real haunted houses in Baltimore as our project. The resulting prototype was colorful and we used origami and cartography to construct it.

The other groups had equally interesting topics and mapped out a life journey and a journey of the movements across the classroom. The energy and enthusiasm in the room was infectious and the learning within the peer group was tremendous.
