The first term was all about personas and presentations. And then we stepped into the world of prototyping. Class one onwards was action oriented. As part of a class activity, we were separated into 3 teams and given markers, coloured paper, cardboard sheets and tape to build a map. The process helped us to get our creative juices going and the results were colorful and intuitive.   

Our group of six classmates brainstormed and came up with various ideas. We finally decided to map out real haunted houses in Baltimore as our project. The resulting prototype was a culmination of cardboard and we used origami and cartography to construct it.

The other groups had equally interesting topics. One of them mapped out a life journey of the student from the time they decided to undertake the classroom to the RIP phase. The other group went on a treasure hunt and found swatches of colored material. They used this to map a journey of the movements across the classroom. The energy and enthusiasm in the room was infectious and the learning within the peer group was tremendous.
