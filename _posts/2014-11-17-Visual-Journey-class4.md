{{Visual Journey}}
================

<p class="meta">

It is already mid term. I remember a journey that I had taken and which tested my limits of endurance. The final part of the journey was a trek up a mountain and the view was my reward. In this class, I am trying to get to my reward. The first few classes felt like I was swimming through a labyrinth and then I started to open and unravel the maze. After 12 hours of classroom time, I was more confident of where this journey was leading and what tools I would need to achieve it.

My visual journey began with Rhino. A fairly simple tool, as I navigated the instructions, I could see my map in 3D with grid lines and contours. the excitement of doing it on my own was tremendous. But I knew this was just the start. My inspiration has always been beautiful flowers and I decided to make that the theme for this blog. One of my favourite flowers is the Cherry Blossom. They thrive in the bitter cold and herald in spring. Their soft hues and delicate appearance are a mirage. They are tough And that epitomises my life. And thats when I decided to take up the challenge and change my project.

We had participated in a competition for educating children in the age group of 0-6 in urban slums. Mapping out the product and its ditribution channels became the prototype map that I wanted to complete. This is where the change started...!

I also started to experiment with colors and coding my blogs to look more interesting. One of the resources was Crayola.json from:
