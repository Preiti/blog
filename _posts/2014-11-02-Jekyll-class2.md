New maps and using words which flowed over my head with Tom MacWright was an experience. Though I could visualise what I was being shown, the process of building it was considerably more complex. The fluidness with which Tom went through the journey was interesting. I decided to  read all the resources on Github and Lynda to get a sense of what I was going to work with in the next 6 weeks.

We went through some styled maps and other resources and then tried to tackle Github and our personal blogs.
