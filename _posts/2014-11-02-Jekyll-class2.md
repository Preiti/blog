New maps and mapping techniques was the order of the day. The class started with a presentation words with Tom MacWright and it was an experience in coding through Mapbox. Though I could visualise what I was being shown, the process of building it was considerably more complex. The fluidness with which Tom went through the journey was interesting. I decided to  read all the resources on Github and Lynda to get a sense of what I was going to work with in the next 6 weeks.

We then went through some styled maps and other resources and then tried to tackle Github and our personal blogs. 

Some of the resources which supported my continuous learning were:

My inspiration comes from maps in video games which are 3D and navigable. Exploring the www, I came across rendered maps in OpenStreetMap, Waze and World of Gothic. Cartography has taken on a new meaning in my head.
